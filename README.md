# display_gpx
Displays a user-specified GPX file using Leaflet.

This utility depends on [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), created by Volodymyr Agafonkin and maintained by a dedicated team of contributors. It also depends on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) for the actual map data it displays.
