# display_gpx

Displays a user-specified GPX file using Leaflet.

This utility depends on [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), created by Volodymyr Agafonkin and maintained by a dedicated team of contributors. It also depends on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) for the actual map data it displays, on [leaflet-gpx](https://github.com/mpetazzoni/leaflet-gpx) to read and display the GPX data, and on [Leaflet.BigImage](https://github.com/pasichnykvasyl/Leaflet.BigImage) to save the map as a PNG file. Additionally, [viewport-units-buggyfill](https://github.com/rodneyrehm/viewport-units-buggyfill) is used to correct window size issues on some mobile devices.
